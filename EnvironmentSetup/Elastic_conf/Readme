This folder contains site.yaml, which is the configuration for ES cluster. Dependent on Ansible.
To set up the cluster one of the pre-requisites is to have a VPN set.

Site.yaml contains the cluster config, it is a 4 server cluster, where 3 of the nodes are master_data nodes, and the 4th one is used a coordination node for the cluster and to be used kibana.

Cluster setup as follows:
1. Install ansible
2. Get the VPN playbook
 2.1 git clone https://github.com/thisismitch/ansible-tinc
 2.2 Create the host inventory file under ~/ansible-tinc/hosts
     Structure as follows:
     [vpn]
     server1 vpn_ip=10.0.0.1 ansible_host=server's PUBLIC IP here
     server2 vpn_ip=10.0.0.2 ansible_host=
     server3 vpn_ip=10.0.0.3 ansible_host= 
     server4 vpn_ip=10.0.0.4 ansible_host=
3. In the same dir run `ansible all -m ping`
4. If your network interface is using different name than eth1, then edit
../group_vars/all on line 4 edit "ansible_eth1.ipv4.address accordingly with your network interface name.
5. Deploy tinc VPN cd to ansible-tinc and run `ansible-playbook site.yml`
6. Test the VPN ping server1
7. Cd to ~/ansible-tinc/roles and run `git clone https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch`
8. mv ansible-elasticsearch elasticsearch
9. cd ~/ansible-playbook and replace the site.yaml file there with the one from this folder
**Check ansible-elastic if you are interested in other options for deployment**
10. Copy the hosts file from this folder to ~/ansible-tinc/, don't touch groups just update the physical addresses to match yours.
11. Run ansible-playbook site.yaml
12. Verify the cluster is running: `curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state?pretty'`


On the node where the coordination server is install Kibana and the xpack plugin, generate a password, update the kibana.yaml to look like the one here.
Please reffer to elasticsearch documentation to see how to build the metricbeats dashboards:
Usually this should work once metricbeats is installed
1. sudo metricbeats enable system
2. sudo metricbeats setup --dashboards --template (the template option will create shard in elasticsearch make sure you run this on the kibana host before enabling metrics on other servers.
3. sudo service metricbeats start
If you experience any issues such as failing to connect to kibana or elasticsearch, specify the protocol to use in kibana.yaml and elasticsearch.yaml as follows:
In kibana.yaml - setup.kibana.protocol: "http"
In elastic.yaml - output.elasticsearch.protocol: "http"

Please note that there is currently an issue with metricbeat and the service won't start on reboot for some reason. If an instance is restarted the service MUST be started manually.
